This repository contains the assignment- 4 for IG Summer AI Program

" This time we present you a sweet and simple assignment. Build a model of Neural Networks with the help of Keras on MNIST dataset. Use Keras.datasets to load the data. Did you get the accuracy ? Now try to change the number of hidden layers, epochs and other parameters and check how the accuracy varies. Now try to understand why the accuracy changed in that particular manner, write about that in the ‘Readme’ file in the Github repository. "
